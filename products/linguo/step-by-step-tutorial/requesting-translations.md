**The pricing section is where it gets more interesting. Here, you will see three parameters: Deadline, MinPrice and MaxPrice.**

The price rises linearly from the start date to the finish date offering an auction-like scenario for translators to decide their own personal acceptable price point for each piece of content.

For example, you can price your translation to be picked up quickly by opening with a high minimum price. Conversely, a broad spread between the minimum and maximum price set over a longer deadline (30 days, for example) gives a steadier price increase over time starting from a more reasonable entry point.

If you just want a fixed price translation with no price discovery, set both the Min and Max price to the same value. The pricing system. High initial prices will likely get your translation completed quicker.
