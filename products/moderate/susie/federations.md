# Federations

Do you have to ban spammers manually, in all your groups? No more! With federations, Susie can enforce a ban on a user in all federate groups.

User commands:

`/getfed` Returns current federation Admin commands:

`/newfed` Creates a federation

`/joinfed` Joins the current group to a Federation
